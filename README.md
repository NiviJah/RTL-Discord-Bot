# RTL - Discord Bot
A bot that makes Right to Left text in Discord readable. Also adds random cats, dogs, and doges.

Basic commands are:
* `$<text>` - Changes the text from Left to Right (eg English) to Right to Left (eg Hebrew)
* `$cat` - Sends a random cat
* `$dog` - Sends a random dog (from reddit)
* `$doge` - Sends a random Shiba Inu (from reddit)
* `<text>^^2` - Squares any text

The bot also automatically detects multilingual text and suggests correcting it:

This is my first bot, originally written in discord.js. I rewrote it in python using discord.py.
